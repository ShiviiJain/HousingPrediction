    "\n",
    "This project explores what can be learned from an extensive housing dataset that is embedded in a dense social context in Cook County, Illinois.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, in project A.1, we will guide you through some basic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the structure of the data. Next, you will be adding a few new features to the dataset, while cleaning the data as well in the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "In project A.2, you will specify and fit a linear model for the purpose of prediction. Finally, we will analyze the error of the model and brainstorm ways to improve the model's performance.\n",

    "Grading is broken down into autograded answers and free response. \n",

    "For autograded answers, the results of your code are compared to provided and/or hidden tests.\n",

Since `Roof Material` is a categorical variable, we will have to one-hot-encode the data.  Notice in the example code below that we have to pre-specify the categories. For more information on categorical data in pandas, refer to this [link](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/categorical.html). For more information on why we want to use one-hot-encoding, refer to this [link](https://machinelearningmastery.com/why-one-hot-encode-data-in-machine-learning/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Complete the following function `ohe_roof_material` that returns a `DataFrame` with the new column one-hot-encoded on the roof material of the household. These new columns should have the form `Roof Material_MATERIAL`. Your function should return a new `DataFrame`, not modify the existing `DataFrame`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: You should avoid using `pd.get_dummies` in your solution as it will remove your original column automactially and is therefore not as reusable as your constructed data preprocessing pipeline. Instead, you can one-hot-encode one column into multiple columns using Scikit-learn's `OneHotEncoder` ([documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.OneHotEncoder.html)). It's far more customizable!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint**: We used `OneHotEncoder` in Lab 7! Here, we are simply contructing the one-hot-encoded columns so do not remove any columns. "
